[arc flatabulous dark grey](https://github.com/metasoftware/arc-grey-theme)

[compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton)

         This repository includes the following content :

         i3 folder with i3 config.
         Polybar folder with polybar config. 
         Compton folder with compton config.
         rofi folder with rofi config.
         
         The scripts folder contains some scripts that
         I personally use, including a shutdown menu that uses rofi.
         You can ignore them if you wish.
